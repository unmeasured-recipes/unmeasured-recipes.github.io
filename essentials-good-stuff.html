                        <p>Before we begin, let’s get our kitchen straight first. There are things you should already own, and there are things you might not—but it's best to invest in these kitchen utensils.</p>

                            <p>Unless you are a savage animal, then you should get a knife. Unless you really are a savage animal, you should get a chopping board. Get a good knife. Every hardware or home department store sells one. You don’t need anything fancy—just a good, sharp, thick knife.
                                For the chopping board, get one that’s wide. One where you can move your vegetables, fruits, and meats around—not the kind where the board itself ends up dancing across the counter.</p>

                            <p>The frying pan we all know is the most versatile pan I’ve ever used. Its shape and shallow center make it perfect for frying and sautéing. It can double as a sauce pan. It can even be used for soups that serve one to three people. And, yes, it’s sturdy enough to knock some sense into you—just ask your lola or nanay.
                                Get one. They're cheap and sold everywhere. Just get the right size for your kind of cooking.</p>

                        <p>You don’t need different kinds of ladles. You just need one. One that’s sturdy enough to handle your everyday life. The secret in choosing? Nothing. Trust your instinct.</p>

                        <p class="post1-section4-first-leftpara">Whether it has a plastic or aluminum handle, you’ll know when it’s solid. Saves you a lot of time. Also helps preserve the actual vegetable instead of peeling half of it away.</p>
                        <p class="post1-section4-first-lefthighlight">There are two peelers in the market—the straight (or swivel) and the Y-peeler. What you get depends on what you prefer. I can’t teach you that. That's on you.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="post1-section4-second-right">
                        <p class="post1-section4-first-rightpara">The swivel—or straight—peeler, in my opinion (and I’ll say that again, in my opinion) is the better of the two. You get more control over the grip, the way it peels, and most of them come with a pitter. You can pit an apple or any other fruit with seeds in the middle. Handy. Efficient. No nonsense.</p>
                        <p class="post1-section4-first-righthighlight">Now, the Y-peeler—it’s not out of the game. It does its job, and does it well. But really, its function is just that—to peel. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

                    <p>There are cheap kitchen towels out there. <span class="highlighted-phrase-post-1"> Mr. DIY sells them for around 30 to 35 pesos. No excuses.</span>  Get a few. Throw one over your shoulder. Keep one near the stove. They’re not just for wiping spills—they’re your first line of defense against burns, mess, and regret.</p>

Distance from the scalding oil or boiling liquid. It’s not about looking cool—it’s about not burning your fingers off.</p>

                        <h3>Wire Rack</h3>
                        <p>Ever wonder why your fried chicken still comes out soggy after damping, laying it flat, and resting it on kitchen tissue? It’s because that oil — the stubborn bastard — doesn’t go anywhere. It just sits there, soaking back into the crust like regret. And if you’re going to pile one chicken after another, it drips down and makes the bottom pieces soggy. You can fix this by crumpling up your tissue and letting the chicken sit there for a while. The crumpled tissue makes little pockets or valleys that kind of carry the chicken, keeping the oil from seeping back into the crust. But come to think of it, that’s just a lot of wasted kitchen tissue. You could’ve used that for something else. So just get a wire rack. Hang your fried chicken, your pork chops, or that fish fillet you keep going back to because it’s easy. Let them drip. Let them dry. And don’t stack them like you’re playing Jenga.</p>

                        <h3>Whisk</h3>
                        <p>A whisk has its place in the kitchen. It's not just for show. When you're mixing roux or working a sauce, the whisk matters. Using it shows you give a damn — that you're not about to let your sauce split and die on the line.</p>
                        <p class="post1-section9-first-lefthighlight">The big whisk is also useful for making any homemade mayonnaise or hollandaise, which we might or might not learn here.</p>
                        <p>You can also use it to beat eggs in a fancy way or you can just use a fork instead. Seriously.</p>

                        <p class="post1-section9-first-righthighlight">But let’s not kid ourselves finding a good one isn’t as easy as yanking something off the department store shelf. And that thing you ordered online? Probably heavier than your anxiety.</p>
                        <p>Still, I suggest having one. Even just a small one. But hey, if you don’t, so we’re cool.</p>

                    <p>But that mojo won’t save you inside an oven or hovering over high heat. You’re not some monk who’s mastered the whole mind-over-matter thing and decided to bare-hand a blistering roasted chicken, a seared pork chop, or a freshly steamed fish.</p>
                    <p>Some proteins — and the way they’re cooked — demand precision. Especially temperature. If you're a steak maniac, you get it. If not, get it anyway.</p>

If you’re getting one, just pick what you can handle. You’ll never know when it might come in handy. If not, then stick with your do-it-all kawali. No one’s judging. </p>

                        <p>Tamis are great for running sauces and purées through — makes everything smoother, silkier, just better. Works wonders on potatoes too if you’re aiming for that creamy mash or proper purée. I’d say get one</p>
                        <p>If not, a regular sieve will do. It won’t give you that three-Michelin-star finish, but hey — no lumps in the sauce, purée, or mash. We’ll take that.</p>

                        <p>Cooking isn’t just the act of applying heat to food. It starts way before the pan gets hot. Preparation is everything. And if you hate it, maybe rethink your life choices — what the hell are you doing here anyway? If you're some rich bastard who leaves the prep to the help, then why even bother stepping into the kitchen?</p>
                        <p>But hey, I get it. I used to hate prep too — the peeling, the slicing, the tedious organizing. But there’s nothing more monstrous than getting halfway through a dish and realizing you’re missing something. I’ve learned that the hard way. More than once.</p>
                    
                            <p>So prep your game plan. Write it down if you have to. Line up your ingredients like little soldiers if your pseudo-OCD tells you to. Nobody cares. That’s your mise en place. Put the salt where it makes sense for you — near the stove, by your hand, whatever. And screw anyone who tells you otherwise.</p>

                    <p class="bolded-phrase-section21">In cooking, it’s gospel — unless the recipe begs otherwise.</p>
                    <p>Because you don’t throw in cabbage before potatoes when making bulalo. But you also don’t put the potatoes in before the onions. It’s about knowing what needs time, and what just needs to show up near the end.</p>

                        <p>There are two holy ways to get beef tender. Sear it fast like a steak, or go low and slow like a stew. That’s it. But let me drop something real — the steak you dream of? It comes from a specific cut, and here, that cut costs a kidney. But beef isn’t just about the steak cut. </p>
                        <p class="bolded-phrase-section22">A whole cow has a lot more to give — cheeks, shanks, ribs, hindquarters, tail, shoulders. Use all of it. Cook it right, and it’ll reward you.</p>
                        <p>There are other tricks too. Koreans use kiwi in their galbi marinade. The Chinese velvet their beef — baking soda, water, cornstarch, science. Restaurants? They cut against the grain like it’s second nature. Others swear by pineapple. Or the good ol’ meat mallet. Every method has a reason behind it. Try them. See what works for your dish. Just don’t expect Oppenheimer-level theory here.</p>

                    <h3>Pork</h3>
                    <p>Pork, in its base taste, is flat. Yeah, I said it. Don’t believe me? Do the test. Salt and pepper on a cut of pork — any cut, I don’t care. Sear it, rest it, taste it. Now tell me why we don’t romanticize pork steak the way we do with beef.</p>
                    <p class="bolded-phrase-section23">But I’ll throw this punch straight to the gut of all the “steak-lovers” out there: I’d take a perfect sinuglaw over an A5 wagyu steak any damn day if I’m playing the “last meal game.”</p>
                    <p>So no, pork is not boring. Far from it. It’s fun. It’s wild. It’s a favorite meat if you know what you are doing. Look at the thousands of dishes we’ve come up with for pork. Start with lechon — pit-roasted pig. That’s pure culinary gospel.</p>
                    <p>Every part of the pig can be eaten — snout to tail. Delicious, if done right. You don’t need fancy tools, just the right kind of care. Know your cuts. Learn the local names in your wet market — they’re your roadmap. Because it’s dumb to use pigue (ham) for sinuglaw or sinugbang baboy when liempo (belly) gives you that fatty, flavorful payoff. But hey, when belly prices spike? Yo can use pigue for humba. Adapt. Be smart. Know your pig.</p>

                    <h3>Chicken</h3>
                    <p>Chicken is confined. It’s not boring — not like the sad, dry turkey the Americans serve every Thanksgiving — but your options, especially if you’re on your own, can feel limited. Lucky for us, we’re Filipinos. Chicken’s been part of our kitchen DNA forever, and we’ve turned it into everything from adobo to arroz caldo.</p>
                    <p class="bolded-phrase-section24">But here’s the deal — chicken is a walking bacteria factory, thanks to salmonella. It’s in the skin. When you rinse it, it sprays around your kitchen like a biological weapon. The only way to kill it? Heat. That’s why you never serve chicken raw. Cook it to 165°F (around 73-75°C). No excuses.</p>
                    <p>And here’s where it gets dicey — especially with chicken breast. It’s delicate. Push it a bit too far, and it turns into dry, stringy regret. So how do you do it right? Medium heat. Keep it moist. If you’re frying, know that breast cooks faster than thigh. Don’t deep-fry it like the rest, or you’ll lose all the juice. Timing matters.</p>

                    <p class="bolded-phrase-section25">What’s the common thread? Heat.</p>
                    <p>So learn how to control it. Learn what low, medium, and high feel like. Learn the difference between a gentle simmer and a rolling boil. Temperature isn’t a suggestion. It’s the invisible force that makes or breaks your dish.</p>

                <h3>The Principles—or Fundamentals—of a Recipe</h3>
                <p>Look, I’ve said it before and I’ll keep saying it: recipes are just guides. They're not commandments handed down from the culinary heavens. But still, they’re written, studied, passed down through generations for a reason—<span>to understand.</span> To get why a dish is what it is. Why it works. Why it tastes like a memory.</p>
                <p>You don’t just magically conjure a dish—you call upon a recipe, or at least the bones of one. And in doing that, you run into the fundamental or principle that makes it a recipe. It might be a key ingredient or a very specific way of cooking. You can’t call it grilled pork if it never met the grill. You can’t call it Sinigang if it doesn’t make your mouth pucker with something sour. It’s that simple.</p>
                <p>Take Adobo.</p>
                <p>You can follow a recipe down to the letter—perfectly measured vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaf, peppercorns—but have you ever stopped and asked: <span>what actually makes an adobo… adobo?</span> Is it the exact list of ingredients? Or the method?</p>
                <p>Strip it down. You'll realize or at best in our understanding at its core, Adobo is a <span>braise.</span> It’s something—meat, veg, seafood—cooked slowly in vinegar (the acid), soy sauce or salt (the salinity), garlic and bay leaf (the aromatics), and peppercorns (for heat, which, frankly, is optional). Whether you sear the meat first or toss it all in and let the alchemy happen, what matters is that slow simmer in sour and salt. That’s the spine of it.</p>
                <div class="post1-section26-bolded-separate">
                    <p>So, does it have to be pork or chicken?</p>
                    <span>No. You can adobo a damn eggplant if you want.</span>
                </div>
                <div class="post1-section26-bolded-separate">
                    <p>Does it have to be brown?</p>
                    <span>No. There’s Adobong Puti—no soy sauce, just salt.</span>
                </div>
                <div class="post1-section26-bolded-separate">
                    <p>Can it have coconut milk?</p>
                    <span>Sure. Some regions do Adobo sa Gata and it still slaps.</span>
                </div>
                <div class="post1-section26-bolded-separate">
                    <p>Does it have to be sweet?</p>
                    <span>Hell no. A little sugar is balance, not a requirement.</span>
                </div>
                <div class="post1-section26-bolded-separate">
                    <p>Should it be dry or saucy?</p>
                    <span>That’s on you. Cook it the way you remember it being cooked—the way it felt like home.</span>
                </div>
                <p>As long as those fundamentals are there—braised in vinegar, tender, bold, and tasting like someone’s story—it’s Adobo. Tweak all you want. Add your flair. Reinvent it even. But if you mess with the backbone too much, then maybe, just maybe, you’ve cooked something else entirely.
                    And hey, maybe that’s fine too. Just don’t lie to yourself about it.</p>

                <p>If you’re reading this, you already know how to cook. You understand the basics. You’ve tasted your own food and know when it’s right or wrong.</p>
                <div class="list-title"><span>So here’s what you do from here on out:</span></div>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Teach your palate.</span> Look, I’m not taking full responsibility if you follow one or two recipes and end up hating them just because you don’t know what they’re supposed to taste like. Either you expand the horizons of which your taste buds can reach, or walk into the unknown like Crocodile Dundee.</li>
                    <li><span>Don’t complicate things.</span> Just know the fundamentals or principle of a recipe. Take it from there.</li>
                    <li><span>And trust your instincts.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>There’s science behind recipes, sure. But those are just theories—until you prove them with your own hands.</p>
                <p>Work with what you have. Don’t stress over what you don’t. That goes for ingredients, tools, and experience.</p>
                <p>Cook with what’s in the market. Cook with what’s in your head. Feed people from your gut, not from a checklist.</p>
                <p>Experiment only when you can afford to fail. And when it counts? Stick to what you know.</p>
