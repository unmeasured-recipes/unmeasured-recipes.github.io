                    <p class="post3-left">If you cook at home, you know this already: there’s always waste. Skins, the ugly bits, and bones — lots of bones (uncooked, please). They pile up in the freezer, waiting. Or worse, they get tossed, forgotten like they’re nothing.</p>
                    <p class="post3-right">But here’s the thing — they’re not nothing. There’s a way to turn that pile of scraps into something that stretches your meals and makes them better. Deeper flavor, less waste. The good stuff. It starts with stock. And no, it doesn’t have to be fancy or complicated. Just real.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="post-3-section-2">
                    <p>Truth is, stock-making never really took root in most Filipino homes. Too slow, too much gas, too much effort. So we leaned on bouillon cubes and MSG — quick hits of umami, no judgment. It works. But you can do better.</p>
                    <p class="post3-section2-yellow">So here’s your move: make your own stock. Build something out of the scraps. Because that’s what real cooking is — using every last bit and making it count.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="section-width-height">
                <div class="post-3-section-3">
                    <p>To make this, there are just a few things to keep in mind.</p>
                    <p>First: <span>simmer, don’t boil.</span> No big bubbles in your stock — just a gentle simmer. That means control and patience. Good stock takes time. It won’t be done in an hour.</p>
                    <p>Next: <span>mirepoix.</span> In classic French cooking, that’s onions, carrots, and celery in a 2:1:1 ratio. But really, think of it as your flavor base — vegetables that build aroma and balance. You’re not stuck with tradition. Adjust based on what you have and the flavor you’re after — Asian, Cajun, Italian, or wherever you want to go.</p>
                    <p>Then there’s the <span>bouquet garni</span> — your bundle of herbs and aromatics. Traditionally, that’s parsley stems, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf. But like the mirepoix, you can swap things out. Thyme hard to find? Use lemongrass for a Southeast Asian touch. Add garlic if that fits your dish. You can tie them up, wrap in cheesecloth, or just throw them in and strain later. The bouquet garni isn’t for eating — it’s there to give your stock a subtle, layered flavor.</p>

                                <span>① Start It Cold. Bones in the pot.</span> Drown them in water — go big, fill it almost to the top. This will cook down, and you’ve still got your mirepoix coming in later. Start it cold, bring it up slow. No rush here.
                                <span>② Simmer and Skim.</span> Keep it at a gentle simmer, never a boil. Around the 30-minute mark, the ugly stuff will rise — scum floating on top. Skim it off like you mean it. Use whatever tool you’ve got: slotted spoon, spatula, ladle. Do this again and again until the stock runs clear. That’s how you know you’re doing it right.
                                <span>③ Drop the Mirepoix.</span> Once your stock looks clean, in goes the mirepoix: carrots, white onions, green onion whites, red bell pepper, garlic. Let it all get cozy in there. And yeah — keep skimming if you need to. No shortcuts.
                                <span>④ Add Your Aromatics.</span> Time for the bouquet garni, laurel, and parsley. This is where the magic starts — layers of background flavor that make stock something more than just flavored water. Drop them in and let them do their thing.
                                <span>⑤ Simmer Low and Slow.</span> Now you wait. Keep it at a low simmer for 3 to 4 hours if you want deep, full flavor that sticks to your ribs. Shorter if you want it lighter. But remember: good stock doesn’t come from rushing. Keep it slow, keep it steady. That’s how you get the good stuff.

It would not just be a shame to let that go to waste — that’s a crime in my book. Pull off every bit of chicken (and skin, if there’s any) and flake it into a bowl. That’s your next meal waiting to happen.</p>
                    <p>Toss it into pasta, pancit, fried rice, or whatever stir-fry you’ve got going. Stir it into arroz caldo if that’s what’s on hand and perfect for the rainy days ahead despite the summer. Point is — don’t let it go to waste. Me? I turn mine into Sweet Soy Chicken Flakes with Crispy Potato Cubes, piled over rice. That hits just right.</p>

                                <span>① Fry the Potatoes.</span> Cube your potatoes and fry them until they’re golden and crisp. Set them aside — they’ll come back for the finale.
                                <span>② Build Your Aromatics.</span> In the same pan, sauté garlic and ginger until the smell hits you — sharp, rich, unmistakable. Drop in your star anise and laurel leaves. Let them bloom in the heat.
                                <span>③ Get the Chicken Bits Going.</span> Add your flaked chicken bits to the pan. Sauté until they pick up some color — golden brown or however you like it. Don’t rush this. Let it get a little texture, a little attitude.
                                <span>④ Mix the Sauce.</span> In a bowl, stir together equal parts soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar. Now, taste it. Adjust while you can — one might shout louder than the others. Balance it until it feels right.
                                <span>⑤ Bring It All Together.</span> Pour the sauce into your pan. Let it cook down until it thickens, or even dries out a bit if that’s your thing. Make it yours.
                                <span>⑥ Finish and Serve.</span> Top it off with chopped green onions and those crispy potato cubes you set aside. Want to go extra? Throw in a sunny-side up egg or some chilies for heat. That’ll hit just right.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Optional</h3>
                            <p>For your first use of the chicken stock you just made, here’s what I did — simple, but it makes all the difference. I used the stock to cook rice, dropped in a piece of star anise, the green tops from the onions I used earlier, and a bit of pressed lemongrass. What came out was rice that smelled like it belonged somewhere far away — soft, fragrant, with a little whisper of Southeast Asia. An easy way to turn plain rice into something worth remembering.</p>
                            <p><span>And that’s just the start. Once you’ve got real stock in your kitchen, doors open — soups get deeper, sauces hit harder, even your plain old fried rice steps up. Use it. Stretch it. Make it count.</span></p>
