                    <p class="post2-left">I don’t remember much about my mother. Trauma does that—it doesn’t erase, just buries. Her death locked memories away, tucking them into the dark, not gone, just waiting, until something stirs them loose.</p>
                    <p class="post2-right">For me, that something is Sundays. The smells, the heat of the kitchen, the way the air feels just before a meal is served—it all brings back flashes. Our family huddled around the dining table, eating, talking, laughing. Sometimes crying, especially if someone refused to eat their damn vegetables.</p>

                    <p>Unless you are a savage animal, then you should get a knife. Unless you really are a savage animal, you should get a chopping board. Get a good knife. Every hardware or home department store sells one. You don’t need anything fancy—just a good, sharp, thick knife.</p>
                    <p>For the chopping board, get one that’s wide. One where you can move your vegetables, fruits, and meats around—not the kind where the board itself ends up dancing across the counter.</p>

                        So I cook. For myself, for my friends, and maybe, one day, for a family of my own. It’s my way of keeping something alive. A small act of defiance against forgetting.

                    <p>It’s rich, unapologetically creamy from gata (a magical ingredient, if there ever was one), with just enough spice to keep things interesting. The mussels bring the ocean. The bola-bola? A practical touch—made from leftover fish flakes, because waste is for amateurs.</p>

                                <span>① Build Your Broth Start with the bones.</span> Simmer your fish scraps in coconut milk. No broth cubes, no shortcuts. Just fish bones and fat. Let it go for 30 minutes—the bones will break down, soften up, spill their secrets into the pot. Add water only if you really must, but keep it all coconut milk if you can. It matters.
                                <span>② Make The Bola-Bola.</span> While the broth simmers, shred your leftover fish. Mix it in a bowl with garlic, onion, an egg, breadcrumbs or bread, and a spoon of flour or cornstarch. Season well with salt and pepper. Use your hands—always your hands. Form into small balls, golf ball-sized. Fry until golden, about 3–5 minutes per side.
                                <span>③ Make That Aromatic Roux.</span> In a new pot—or the same one if you are to get the brownbits (I highly suggest this one)—Melt butter. Sauté onion, ginger, and green chili until it starts to smell like something good’s about to happen. Sprinkle in flour. Stir. Let it toast a little. That’s your roux—your base of flavor and body.
                                <span>④ Bring It All Together.</span> Pour in your fishy coconut stock. Stir to smooth out the roux. Add potatoes or sweet potatoes if you’ve got some. Simmer until fork-tender and falling apart. Toss in your mussels. With or without shells—you choose. Let them cook for around 6 minutes.
                                <span>⑤ Finish Strong.</span> Now drop in the fried fish balls. Let them soak in that creamy ocean mess for a few minutes. Or just place them in your bowl and pour the chowder right over. Sprinkle with chopped green onions. Maybe another chili if you're feeling bold. 
                            </p>
                            <h3>Optional, or the Classic Way</h3>
                            <p>Near the end of your broth-making, you can toss in your mussels—shells on or off, your call. Let them soak and release all that briny, saline goodness. Once they’re cooked through, fish them out and set them aside.</p>
                            <p>Now, if you want to go the classic route, swap the butter for bacon fat when making your roux. In the same pot where you fried your fish bola-bola (because flavor lives in those brown bits), fry up some chopped bacon until crisp and golden. Pull them out and keep them for later.</p>
                            <p>Use that leftover fat to sauté your onions, ginger, and green chili—until it smells like something’s about to happen. Then, sprinkle in your flour. Stir it into a roux, let it toast a little. That’s your base. You can finish it with a splash of cream or coconut cream if you want it extra thick and rich</p>
                            <p><span>Sprinkle those bacon bits on top when you serve. Adds crunch, adds smoke, adds soul.</span></p>
